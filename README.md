# Project: Image Captioning

This repository contains a solution for the second project of [**Computer Vision Nanodegree program**](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

In this project, we will create and train a CNN-RNN model on the [**Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO)**](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset to automatically generate captions from images.
